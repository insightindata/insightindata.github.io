## Ronald Bodderij

This year is a special year with special circumstances. The global pandemic forces us to be more at home and this gives time for reflecting on where I stand and where I would like to go. In 2017 i switched to IT to work for a Serviceprovider for insurances and specialised in insurtech. I already had a background in insurances and an interest in IT. 

After getting my Amazon Cloud Practitioner certificate I was looking for new areas to develop in and got interested in machine learning and big data. Took a course in SQL and started with Python. By chance I stumbled upon the world of Data Visualisation and Tableau and the possibilities to analyse data and show patterns, trends and outliers in data and visualise insights. 

Recently I did the Tableau Desktop Specialist exam and passed. I will develop my skills further with projects and other sources for information like books and courses. Eventually I hope to analyse and visualise data profesionnaly.
