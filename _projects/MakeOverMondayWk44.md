MakeOverMonday Week 44

This week there is a new project on <a href="https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w44">Makeover Monday</a> about the gender gap between men and woman in 100 countries that have access to internet/mobile. Viz5 is a collaboration between Makeover Monday and Operation Fistula to promote gender equality and bring awareness about the subject. 

Here you can find the original dataset and visualization: <a href="https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w44">data.world</a>
and a link to my visualization: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/ronald.bodderij#!/vizhome/MakeOvermondayWk44Year2020/MakeOverMondayWk44">Tableau Public</a>

I tried many different visualizations to show a meaningful insight. The amount of countries made it difficult to create a visualisation that didn't need a scroll bar or a large portion of the screen. 

There were three columns in the dataset:
- Internet users; % of households
- Gender gap in internet access; % difference
- Gender gap in mobile phone access; % difference

At first I was trying to relate the percentage of households with internet to the gender gap in internet access and mobile phone access. Eventually I decided it would be more insightful to just focus on the gender gap in internet access and mobile phone access. The visualizations show that in the majority of the 100 countries in the dataset, there are more men with access then women. Pakistan is a real outlier in the visualisation.
