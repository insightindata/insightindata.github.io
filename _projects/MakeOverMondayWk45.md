MakeOverMonday Week 45

New week, new project on <a href="https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/">Makeover Monday</a> about Nintendo Switch sales of hardware and software. The amount of units and software sold between March 2017 and March 2020 are showing exponential growth.

Here you can find the original dataset and visualization: <a href="https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w45-dedicated-video-game-sales-units">data.world</a>
and a link to my visualization: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/ronald.bodderij#!/vizhome/MakeOvermondayWk45Year2020/MakeoverMondayWk45">Tableau Public</a>

Like previous weeks the dataset contained a small amount of data. My first thought was that the amounts in the dataset are ten thousand units. For my visualization it would be clearer to multiply the amounts times ten thousand. The other option would be that I would show on the axis title that it was times ten thousand. 

To be able to make a year of year comparison, I needed to use the date in the headers of the dataset. I was unfamaliar with how this can be done in Tableau, so I searched online and discovered that I needed to select the tables with the years in the dataset and pivot the table. This gave a column which could be used as date. 

Eventually in making the dashboard, I used a picture of a Nintendo Switch console, to make the visualization more interesting and appealing. I enjoyed learning new techniques and ways to show data.
