## Certification

Earlier this year, when I decided to learn to work with Tableau software, I checked out the certification options that are available. 

- Tableau Desktop Specialist
- Tableau Certified Associate
- Tableau Certified Professional

The Desktop Specialist certification is the entry level certification. Tableau recommends at least three months experience and have foundational skills and understanding of Tableau Desktop.

## Prepration

To prepare for the exam I used the following courses:

- Tableau Desktop I â€“ Fundamentals
- Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification Guide on Udemy

For some extra practice I bought a three exam bundle for Desktop Specialist.
